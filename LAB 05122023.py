'''Error:- These are unexpected events or conditions that prevent
the normal execution of a program. There are 3 main types of errors:
    1. Syntax error
    2. Runtime error
    3. Logical error
    
In python, try, except and finally are keywords used for exception 
handling, allowing you to gracefully manage errors and unexpected
situations in your code.
